# TravelEase - Responsive Travel Web App Landing Page

## 1. Project Overview
This project is a responsive travel landing page built to demonstrate modern web development skills. It adapts seamlessly across all devices, including mobile (≤768px), tablet (769-1024px), and desktop (>1024px).

## 2. Project Description
In this project, I have implemented the **fundamentals of HTML5 and CSS3**. I focused on building a clean semantic structure, a responsive grid for travel destinations, and a functional contact form with basic validation.

## 3. Tech Stack
The following technologies were used to build this project:
- **HTML5:** For page structure using semantic tags (header, nav, main, section, footer).
- **CSS3:** For layout design using Flexbox, CSS Grid, and Media Queries.
- **Git & GitHub:** For version control and hosting via GitHub Pages.

## 4. Key Features
- **Responsive Navigation:** A mobile-friendly hamburger menu for easy browsing.
- **Hero Section:** A compelling travel banner with a tagline and Call-to-Action (CTA) button.
- **Destinations Grid:** Showcases popular travel spots that stack vertically on mobile and horizontally on larger screens.
- **Contact Form:** A user-friendly form with fields for Name, Email, and Message.
- **Responsive Images:** All images are optimized with `max-width: 100%` to prevent layout breaks.
